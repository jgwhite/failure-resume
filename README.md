## Failures to expand upon

- Was rejected from an Art & Design foundation programme! (back before I
  picked technology as a career)
- Failed to deliver what should have been a simple feature for a client
  because I got bogged down in an enormous rewrite of the crummy code I’d
  written for one of my early attempts at a Rails app.
- Failed to deliver the new version of the site for a friend’s business,
  despite bringing on a talented contractor, and taking the full fee in
  advance. Ended up returning the fee in full.
- Failed to get beyond the whiteboard with a major new platform feature for a
  product I worked on. I was the tech lead, given essentially a blank canvas.
  Tied myself in knots and wasted time doing anything other than working on it
  when I should have done a tiny bit every day.
- Failed to adequately lead/mentor a colleague through a project and saw his
  mood/mental health decline as a result. This one still really hurts.
- Made the wrong architectural choice for a project and never heard the end
  of it. What was my reasoning at the time? I think it came down to
  familiarity. I was missing the bigger picture.
- Made the wrong architectural choice for *another* project. This time it
  meant never really being able to achieve satisfactory performance.
- Every project I “ran” during my years working at consultancies came in over
  budget. Sometimes hilariously so.
- Handed over an open source project but failed to ensure it stayed healthy
  when the other maintainer had to step aside.
- Abjectly failed to deliver on an open-source commission. I went full
  architecture-astronaut and didn’t get anywhere near the goal. Fortunately I
  never took any money for it, just wasted some of the client’s time and a lot
  of my own.
- Panicked and tried to pull out of organising a conference in London.
  Luckily got talked around by one of my absolute heroes/mentors.
- Gave a very scrappy talk at React London that essentially ran out of script
  half way through. Not sure the crowd bought my improvised ending.
- Failed to effectively mentor a direct report (we were remote). They ended
  up in many stressful situations. I might have been able to help them avoid a
  few.
- Have started many many online courses and never finished any of them.
